# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?

It means to have many forms.

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a
simple Java example.

public class ElectricCar extends Vehicle{

    private ElectricEngine electricEngine;

    public ElectricCar( int price, String colour) {
        super(price, colour);
        this.electricEngine = electricEngine;

It allows us to give many forms to a simple object by using  That is, a class
can have multiple forms depending on what you want it to do.

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
It allows us to give many forms to a simple object by using extends  That is, a class
can have multiple forms depending on what you want it to do.
Pollymorphism can be implemented in both abstract classes and interfaces.

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
As many as needed.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
When creating different types of car, it would help to reuse many of
the same elements, for example Motorcycle, van and car, as all types
of vehicle. Which is to say a car is a vehicle it has the qualities of
vehicle passed down to it.



# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Composition means that the object in question is composed of certain
elements form the object, giving it attributes.

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

public class Printer extends PrintingDevice implements IOutput {
    private int dpi;
    private int printSpeed;

    public Printer(String make, String model, int dpi, int printSpeed) {
        super(make, model);
        this.dpi = dpi;
        this.printSpeed = printSpeed;
    }

    public int getDpi() {
        return this.dpi;
    }
If I wanted to make a printer, it would make sense to create an things like print speed and
dpi, (as I might want to use them for another printing device) In this case, rather
than pass the attributes directly into the new printer I would compose the printer
from the objects.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

It can be a simpler that using inheritance, as you can see what the
object is composed of.

9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is
composed of?
They are destroye
